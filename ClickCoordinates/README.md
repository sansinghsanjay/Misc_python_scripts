# ClickCoordinates  
This Python script will help to know the coordinates of any point on an image just by clicking there.  
This functionality will help in annotating the images for object detection use cases. To accomplish this, one has to click on the corners (generally top-left corner and bottom-right corner) of the object of interest and the script will print those coordinates on image as well as on terminal.
